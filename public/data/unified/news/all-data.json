US President <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/trump\">Donald Trump</a> made clear that the region is undergoing a strategic realignment and a power struggle between Israel and the Arab states.</p>\n\n<p>Although the direction of this regional shift remains unclear, <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/palestine\">Palestinian</a> interests are entirely absent from the equation.</p>\n\n<h3>Arab interests</h3>\n\n<p>Since the so-called ceasefire took effect, Israel has unsurprisingly continued the policies we witnessed in <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/lebanon\">Lebanon</a> over the past year, following the November 2024 <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/full-text-ceasefire-agreement-lebanon-and-israel\">ceasefire</a> with <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/hezbollah\">Hezbollah</a>, where it committed more than <a href=\"https://www.lbcgroup.tv/news/lebanon-news/859016/lebanon-records-over-3500-israeli-violations-since-november-ceasefire/en\">3,500 violations</a>, killing over 100 Lebanese civilians and dozens of Hezbollah fighters.</p>\n\n<p>And now, only one month after the Gaza ceasefire - an agreement negotiated in <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/saudi-and-emirati-rulers-sharm-el-sheikh-no-show-reveals-tensions-egypt-over-gaza\">Sharm el-Sheikh</a> between the US and Arab and Muslim states, without Palestinian or Israeli participation - Israel has already carried out hundreds of <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/full-list-israels-ceasefire-violations-gaza\">violations</a> and killed nearly <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/342-gazans-killed-in-israeli-violations-since-ceasefire-authorities/3751279\">350 Palestinians</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This chain of events demonstrates the regional restructuring underway.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The primary interest of Arab states since the start of the genocide has been preventing the displacement of Palestinians to their territories</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A crucial moment was the Israeli <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/doha-strikes-shred-pretence-israeli-diplomacy-and-shock-captives-families\">strike on Doha</a> on 9 September, the failed attempt to assassinate Hamas leader <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/live-blog/live-blog-update/khalil-al-hayya-makes-first-tv-appearance-israel-targeted-him-doha\">Khalil al-Hayya</a>, which signalled to Arab states that Israel is willing to operate inside Arab capitals whenever it deems necessary, even against the advice of its own intelligence agencies.</p>\n\n<p>This&nbsp;clearly demonstrated that Israel is not acting as a rational actor; in reality, the Israeli right means precisely what it says, and its politicians must be taken seriously even when their statements appear delusional.</p>\n\n<p>Once Arab states began to perceive a growing threat, a new kind of international politics emerged in which they began using their leverage to restrain Israel.</p>\n\n<p>This has meant imposing a ceasefire over the Israeli far right's objections; an American airlift to keep Israel bound to it; and direct US <a href=\"https://abc7.com/post/us-envoys-arrive-israel-shore-gaza-ceasefire-major-flareup/18044305/\">intervention</a> in Israeli politics that takes into account <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-has-talked-with-gulf-states-about-post-war-gaza-administration-envoy-says-2025-09-19/\">Arab interests</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The primary interest of Arab states since the start of the genocide has been preventing the <a href=\"https://www.petra.gov.jo/Include/InnerPage.jsp?ID=75476&amp;lang=en&amp;name=en_news&amp;cat=en_news\">displacement</a> of Palestinians to their <a href=\"https://english.aawsat.com/arab-world/5124609-egypt-rejects-israeli-claims-relocating-gazans-sinai\">territories</a>, particularly <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/egypt\">Egypt</a> and <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/jordan\">Jordan</a>, out of fear of political destabilisation.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, these states want Israel to <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-attacks-iran\">confront</a> <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/iran\">Iran</a> and its allies without requiring direct Arab involvement or triggering a regional war.</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div class=\"adsense responsive\">\n    <script

Palestinian cause, what we are witnessing is the formation of new operating lines for Israel: on the one hand, restrictions on regional escalation; on the other hand, no meaningful intervention regarding Palestinian life.</p>\n\n<p>Just last week, yet another Israeli attempt to forcibly relocate Palestinians was exposed when a plane landed in South Africa carrying dozens of people from Gaza under \"<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3dn3g4jdxjo\">mysterious</a>\" circumstances, revealing that plans for Palestinian expulsions are still active.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a

»</a>\n</div>\n\n<p>Without such support, the far right's aspirations of annexation and population transfer have collided with political reality.</p>\n\n<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who heads the most extreme government in the country's history and who has enjoyed broad public support for genocide and displacement, now finds himself constrained by Washington's intervention.</p>\n\n<p>This has <a href=\"https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2025/10/06/netanyahu-faces-far-right-revolt-as-trump-pushes-for-end-to-gaza-war/\">created a crisis</a> within the right, which cannot openly challenge the US, especially with Trump as president and at a time when <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/support-for-israel-continues-to-deteriorate-especially-among-democrats-and-young-people/\">anti-Israel sentiment</a> is growing among Republicans and Democrats alike.</p>\n\n<p>Compensation for these constraints comes in the form of a free hand in <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/11/israel-must-immediately-halt-legislation-of-discriminatory-death-penalty-bill/\">anti-Palestinian legislation</a> and <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-pummel-gaza-dozens-killed-after-un-adopts-resolution-trump-plan\">intensified</a> military operations against Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank and, as we saw this week, inside Lebanon after Israel bombed <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-strike-palestinian-refugee-camp-lebanon\">Ain&nbsp;al-Hilweh</a>&nbsp;refugee camp and southern Beirut.</p>\n\n<p>Not only are Palestinians excluded from international forums discussing Gaza, but the knowledge that Arab states will not act on their behalf creates a new equation: the more Israel is restrained regionally, the more aggressively it acts against Palestinians.</p>\n\n<p>What appears temporary is being consolidated into permanent policy.</p>\n\n<h3>Escalation ahead</h3>\n\n<p>In last week's <a href=\"https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/yokra14584389?utm_source=ynet.app.ios&amp;utm_term=yokra14584389&amp;utm_campaign=general_share&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=Header\">defence budget</a> discussions, the army requested that Israel's 2026 defence budget remain around 140 billion shekels ($38bn), despite the ceasefire, similar to the 2025 level and roughly $30bn more than the finance ministry's estimate.</p>\n\n<p>It also requested maintaining a reserve force of 60,000 soldiers, 10 times larger than before the genocide.</p>\n\n<p>All of this is justified by claims of rising threats, particularly in the north, and the need to continue holding the territories captured in <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/syria\">Syria</a>, while preparing for further rounds of fighting.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-align-center\"><iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hh9PHmsQyy8?si=BZmFtgx6mV55WD3I\" title=\"YouTube video player\" width=\"560\"></iframe></p>\n\n<p>The regional reconfiguration places Israel in an uncomfortable and uncertain position, something Israel neither likes nor easily accepts.</p>\n\n<p>It is unaccustomed to a reality in which its dominance over Arab states is no longer assured, neither in Washington nor on the military level.</p>\n\n<p>From this weakened position, Israel is preparing for a reality in which it will need to use even more force to strengthen its standing in regional negotiations and political bargaining.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the Arab states, having achieved significant gains, are now attempting to revive the idea of recognising a <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/palestine-state\">Palestinian state</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The more Israel is restrained regionally, the more aggressively it acts against Palestinians</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Too little, too late.</p>\n\n<p>The entire discussion around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hh9PHmsQyy8\">statehood recognition</a>, or linking normalisation to a pathway towards it, is devoid of substance.</p>\n\n<p>First, this is no longer possible. Every day, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Settlement Minister Orit Strock advance policies in the West Bank that create <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/22/israels-parliament-advances-bill-to-annex-occupied-west-bank\">de facto annexation</a> and facts on the ground that will be nearly impossible to reverse.</p>\n\n<p>Second, beyond Arab public opinion, Arab states themselves recognise the magnitude of Israel's actions over the past two years and the trajectory of events locally and internationally, and they understand that Israel is now preparing for further rounds of conflict.</p>\n\n<p>Once again, contrary to longstanding Arab assumptions, Israel is not a rational actor, and it will not relinquish its aggressive regional posture easily, especially when it comes to Palestinians.</p>\n\n<p>And as long as Arab states continue to operate solely from their narrow interests rather than engage seriously with the future of the Palestinian people, the region will remain unstable and on a path towards further wars.</p>\n\n<p><i>The views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Eye.</i></p>\n</div>\n                  <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/israel-genocide-gaza\" hreflang=\"en\">Israel's genocide in Gaza</a></div>\n                  <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/all\" hreflang=\"en\">Opinion</a></div>\n        <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\">\n    <div>Post Date Override</div>\n              <div>0</div>\n          </div>\n  <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\">\n    <div>Update Date</div>\n              <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:29:16+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:29</time>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\">\n    <div>Update Date Override</div>\n              <div>0</div>\n          </div>\n\n  </div>\n  \n</article>",

Almost three months later, when GHF set up militarised operations, starvation was widespread in Gaza as supplies were in short supply or non-existent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Experienced NGOs and aid distributors expressed concern about both GHF’s delivery model and the complete lack of experience in delivering aid.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>‘Death traps’</h3>\n\n<p>Unlike other NGOs, GHF did not directly provide aid to people in need. Instead, it opened four distribution sites in the south of the Gaza Strip and required people in the enclave to travel there, even if it meant walking for days. It was especially challenging for those in the north, where there were no food distribution services.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\">\n  <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/soaked-in-blood-how-gaza-aid-sites-became-death-traps-palestinians\"><img class=\"mee-readmore-image\" src=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/soaked-in-blood-mee-documentary.jpg.webp?itok=twEpR67L\" width=\"400\" height=\"250\" alt loading=\"lazy\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\">\n\n</a>  <div class=\"mee-readmore-description\">Soaked in Blood: How Gaza's aid sites became death traps for starving Palestinians</div>\n    <a class=\"mee-readmore-link\" href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/soaked-in-blood-how-gaza-aid-sites-became-death-traps-palestinians\">Read More »</a>\n</div>\n\n<p>If people did not fall sick or die while travelling there, they were at risk of being injured or killed trying to obtain aid at the sites where armed Israeli soldiers and US security contractors operated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>According to whistleblowers such as Anthony Aguilar, other witnesses and videos shared to social media, many Palestinians were said to have been deliberately shot by Israeli soldiers or US security contractors hired by GHF, after following direct orders from their superiors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Despite this, thousands of Palestinians braved going to GHF sites every day to obtain food for themselves and their families, until a ceasefire was reached on 10 October.</p>\n\n<p>Gaza's health ministry reported that, in addition to over 2,600 Palestinians who were killed, at least 19,182 were injured while trying to get aid while GHF operated.</p>\n\n<p>The GHF has denied that anyone was killed at their sites and says the UN figures on the number of aid seekers killed are \"false and misleading\", saying that it only fired warning shots at aid seekers.</p>\n\n<p>Questions still surround GHF, including its funding sources.

to designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organisation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz is pushing a bill that would designate the Muslim Brotherhood a terror organisation, with Republican Senator Tom Cotton and Democratic Senator John Fetterman among the cosponsors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The House of Representatives has its own version of the bill co-sponsored by four Democrats, including Jared Moskowitz, Thomas Suozzi and John Gottheimer. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But Trump does not need new legislation to list the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organisation, as that power is already provided by the Immigration and Nationality Act.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Under the law, the Secretary of State initiates a process to designate a group based on certain criteria; the organisation must be foreign, and the State Department must assess that it is engaging in terrorist activity that threatens the US.&nbsp;</p><div class=\"block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block\"><div>\n  <div

engaged in a process to assess the various branches of the Muslim Brotherhood, calling it a “process which I didn’t fully appreciate until I came into this job”.</p>\n\n<p>Trump’s move to designate the Muslim Brotherhood is a continuation of efforts that started during his first administration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Trump apparently began pushing the move in earnest after&nbsp;<span style=\"margin:

national security advisor, John Bolton, and Mike Pompeo, the former Secretary of State, supported the move, while US government lawyers, defence officials and career national security staff voiced objections, the paper reported.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced earlier this month that he was designating the Muslim Brotherhood as well as the Council on American Islamic Relations (Cair) - the largest civil liberties group for American Muslims - as both foreign terrorist organisations and transnational criminal organisations.</p>\n\n<p>That decision has a local impact and stops both groups \"from purchasing or acquiring land\" in the state of Texas,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://x.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/1990800292225691720?s=20\" target=\"_blank\">Abbott

attorney general leeway to sue the groups accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>What is the Muslim Brotherhood?</h3>\n\n<p>The Muslim Brotherhood is most commonly known in the Arab world as a political party founded on Islamic principles and laws, whose support skyrocketed in the wake of the 2011 Arab protests aimed at overthrowing autocratic rulers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It was established in the late 1920s in Egypt in opposition to British colonial rule.</p>\n\n<div class=\"mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right\">\n  <a class=\"mee-readmore-img-link\"

Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser and Hafez al-Assad of Syria. However, the Muslim Brotherhood gained popularity in the 1970s and 1980s as secular, authoritarian governments pushed modernisation and western agendas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In 2012, after the toppling of Hosni Mubarak,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/egypt\">Egypt's</a> ruler for three decades, an internationally monitored election in Egypt saw the victory of the country's first Muslim Brotherhood president, Mohamed Morsi.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Sisi was a former head of military intelligence and later minister of defence to Morsi. In 2013, Sisi spearheaded a coup that ousted Morsi from power and led a violent crackdown on members of the group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Tensions over the group culminated in a rift between regional powers Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE. The UAE and Saudi Arabia led a blockade of Qatar and fought proxy wars with Turkey in countries like Libya.</p>\n\n<p>More recently, the Gulf states have tried to patch up ties, but the Muslim Brotherhood remains a point of contention in the region. Many monarchies view the group as a threat to their dynastic rule.</p>\n\n<h3>In the region</h3>\n\n<p>The Muslim Brotherhood’s sway in the Middle East has ebbed since the toppling of Morsi, but the group still retains support in the region.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In Tunisia, the Ennahda party, which is affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, has been harassed and its leadership arrested. President Kais Said, who was democratically elected, has consolidated power in his hands, shuttered the parliament and purged the country of political opponents, secular and Islamist alike.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In other areas, however, the US’s allies have worked with governments supported by local parties seen as close to the Muslim Brotherhood.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For example, Yemen’s internationally recognised government, which is backed by Saudi Arabia, includes members of the Islah party, which has historically been close to the Muslim Brotherhood.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The US itself has shown no qualms about working with self-declared Islamist leaders, such as Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who served roughly five years in a US prison after travelling to Iraq to repel the 2003 US invasion of the country. Sharaa went on to found al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda's Syrian branch. He was only officially removed from the US terror list in November, before his White House visit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If Trump does move forward with the designation of the Muslim Brotherhood, the group could appeal it at the US Court of Appeals in Washington, DC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>One of the challenges in this case is that the Muslim Brotherhood lacks central leadership and is mainly composed of various parties and groups affiliated with it, often through loose ideological connections.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For example, Hamas is affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood and was designated a terror organisation in 1987. The US also designated the secular Palestinian Liberation Organisation as a terror group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Muslim Brotherhood is now banned in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates, and <a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/jordan-bans-muslim-brotherhood-and-its-ideology\">most recently</a> in Jordan.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n                  <div class=\"field field-field-topic\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/us-politics\" hreflang=\"en\">US Politics</a></div>\n            <div class=\"field field-field-coauthor-location\">\n              <div> </div>\n              <div> </div>\n              <div> </div>\n              <div> </div>\n          </div>\n              <div class=\"field field-field-article-location\"> </div>\n                  <div class=\"field field-field-section\"><a href=\"https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all\" hreflang=\"en\">News</a></div>\n        <div class=\"field field-field-post-date-override\">\n    <div>Post Date Override</div>\n              <div>0</div>\n          </div>\n  <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-override\">\n    <div>Update Date</div>\n              <div><time datetime=\"2020-05-04T21:19:45+01:00\">Mon, 05/04/2020 - 21:19</time>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  <div class=\"field field-field-update-date-check\">\n    <div>Update Date Override</div>\n              <div>0</div>\n          </div>\n\n  </div>\n  \n</article>",

southern suburbs known as Dahyeh, killing five people and wounding 28, according to Lebanon’s health ministry.</p>\n\n<p>A source close to Hezbollah said Tabatabai had been based abroad and returned to Lebanon after Israel killed senior Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in July.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>'Ultimately, Israel wants free rein to act as it wishes in Lebanon, just as it does in southern Syria'</p>\n\n<p>- <em>Ali Rizk, Lebanese security analyst</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lebanese security analyst Ali Rizk believes the assassination of a senior military figure is part of a broader escalation on the Lebanese front and could signal a new phase in Israel’s operations.</p>\n\n<p>Rizk said Israel holds the upper hand in its intelligence war with Hezbollah.</p>\n\n<p>This, Rizk said, has been clear ever since September 2024, when Israel escalated border clashes by detonating thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by members of Hezbollah, in an attack that rocked the movement and wounded men, women and children.</p>\n\n<p>Israel also demonstrated Hezbollah's deep intelligence penetration by killing most of its top brass, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah,&nbsp;Aqil, who led the elite Radwan unit, and Ali Karake, who was the number three military commander.</p>\n\n<p>“That’s why Israel might continue doing what it’s doing, because this is
